          We present a shooting robot game that we designed and built using
          two Raspberry Pis, a PiTFT, motors, servos, and Bluetooth communication. Our
          objective was to create an engaging and fun game and to demonstrate what
          we have learned throughout the semester. The game is playable by one
          player. Here we will describe the design, testing, and results of
          our project.

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left; padding: 0px 30px">
          We used a Raspberry Pi as the main controller for both the robot car and
          the gun station. The robot car uses two motors, a motor controller and
          controlled by hardware PWM, and had two balloon flags that moved through
          servos controlled by software PWM. The gun station had a camera and
          used color detection to detect whether the gun is aiming at one of the balloons
          and a button for triggering the detection process and
          starting / stopping the game. The two components communicated with each
          other via Bluetooth.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the button from the gun is pressed for the first time, the
          balloon flags will raise (if they are not already) indicating the start 
          of the game. Then the robot will move randomly. The player then will try 
          to aim the camera at the balloon targets and use the button to "shoot." 
          When the button is pressed, the camera will take a picture, then analyze 
          the center of the image to detect the most prominent color. It then sends 
          this color to the robot. If the color is one of the flags', the robot will 
          put down the flag by rotating the servo. When both targets are down, the 
          player has won the game, and the robot will stop. Pressing the button after 
          the game has been won will start the game again. After the first target is 
          down, the player has 5 chances to shoot down the other one. Failing to do 
          so will result in both of the flags being raised again. There is also an 
          emergency stop "button," which is green. When the button on the gun is 
          pressed and the camera detects green, the robot will stop. Pressing the 
          button again will restart the game.

        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left; padding: 0px 30px">
          We tested our shooting robot game by playing it many times to ensure that it 
          worked as intended and was free of bugs and glitches. The only glitch and or 
          bug is that one could cheat at our game by "shooting" at something blue or 
          yellow that is not the balloons. We performed multiple rounds of testing, 
          including hardware and software tests for each seperate unit, and, as stated 
          earlier, playing the game many times. the overall playing experience. Our game
          works as expected.

      <div style="text-align: center">
        <h2>Result</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left; padding: 0px 30px">
          Our shooting robot game was successful in achieving its objective of
          providing an engaging and fun game. We received positive feedback from
          test users and were able to identify areas for improvement to make the
          game even better if we had more time to work on the project. If we were
          to work on the project longer, we would add more balloons to create more
          targets for the user to need to shoot down. We would also create multiple
          difficulty levels that utilized the speed of the robot and varying levels
          of unpredictability to create a more challenging experience for those that
          wanted the game to be harder.
